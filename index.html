        My name is Michael Takamoto. I graduated from Santa Clara University wih a degree in philosophy. I've worked in the software industry for several decades. I've woked for really large companies like Oracle, and I've worked for other companies in which I was the 3rd employee. I do prefer small companies becuase your work has an immediate impact and you don't have so many layers of decision making. I enjoy learning and using new technology and tools. In my spare time, I like to train my two husky dogs to mush.
