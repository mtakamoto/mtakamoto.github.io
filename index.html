        My name is Michael Takamoto. I graduated from Santa Clara University wih a degree in philosophy. I've worked in the software industry for several decades. I've woked for really large companies like Oracle and I've worked for really small companies in which I was the 3rd employee. I prefer small companies because your work has an immediate impact and you don't have so many layers of decision making. I enjoy learning and using new technology and tools. </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to train my two husky dogs to mush. Currently I do urban mushing with them (I hook them up to a scooter and ride around the Peninsula), but hope to buy a sled in the future and be able to take them to Tahoe often.
